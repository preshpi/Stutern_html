        <h2>FRIED RICE</h2>
        <p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried
        in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients
        such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment
        to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain
        South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried
        rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations.
        Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace 
        their origins to Chinese fried rice.

            <h4>STEPS/METHOD ON HOW TO PREPARE FRIED RICW</h4>
            <p>Using the above listed measurements;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thoroughly wash rice with salt till the water is clean, set aside in a sieve to remove excess water. (The essence of washing rice with salt is to remove excess starch).</li>
                <li>In a medium pan, heat up vegetable oil on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the long grain rice and fry for two (2) to five (5) minutes</li>
                <li>Add turmeric powder, rosemary, white pepper, crushed seasoning cubes, salt to taste. Combine thoroughly with the rice and continue frying till it tastes dry and crispy.                </li>
                <li>Add three (3) cups of chicken stock or water and cook till it is 85% done.</li>
            </ul>   
                <p>While that is ongoing,</p>
               <ol>
                <li>In a medium size pan, melt salted cooking butter on medium heat, add finely diced carrots and sauté for one (1) minute.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic, diced onions, diced red and green bell pepper and sauté till it is translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the vegetables and the liver to the cooked rice.                </li>
                <li>Add the sweet corn, stir thoroughly to incorporate all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Leave to simmer for five (5) minutes.                </li>
                <li>Add the spring onions, give it a thorough stir.</li>
                <li>Stir in the green peas and turn off heat immediately.</li>
              </ol>
            <p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>  
            <blockquote>
                "Cooking butter adds a unique taste to grains and it prevents it from being sticky. I used turmeric powder instead of the conventional curry because
                 of the health benefits of turmeric powder. If you are using turmeric powder as advised, you have to be extremely careful and it is important to control the amount, if you don’t want your
                 rice looking yellow or funny. Using turmeric powder is gonna be a biggie? To be on the safer side, you can use curry so as not to mess your rice. You can parboil the rice if you don’t want
                  to fry but frying the rice gives it a perfect fried taste."
