              <i>The differences between Padding, Margin and Borders</i> <br>
              <b>Padding</b>  is the space between the content and the border.<br>
              <b>Margin</b> is the space outside the border. <br>
              <b>Border</b> is the strip that goes around your div/element of the content.
